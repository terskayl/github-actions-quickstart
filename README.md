# github-actions-quickstart
CIS 3500 HW 2 - Part 1

In this repo, I followed along to the quickstart for github actions here: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/quickstart
I also submitted feedback for the documentation page. I left a thumbs up, with the following text:
"The documentation was clear and easy to follow along with. I followed the documentation, creating my own repository with the provided .yml file, and I encountered no complications."
